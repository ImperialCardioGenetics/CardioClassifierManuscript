## Variant Curation Guidelines

### Functional Data

Is there any solid functional data supporting a damaging effect of the mutation? In general mouse/rat models, studies using tissue biopsies or RNA studies assessing affects of splicing variants are good. Cell assays are often less likely to represent in vivo effects. Generally use common sense - do you believe it?

Annotate Y/N in one column and note down reference(s) in the second column.

### Segregation Data

Has the variant ever been reported to segregate in a family? This information could either be within a publication or a ClinVar report.

Note down Y/N plus the strength of segregation - how many individuals and from how many families? And also note any publications or ClinVar submission IDs.

### De novo Data

Has the variant been reported to have arrisen de novo (not seen in either parent)? If yes, do they mention confirmation of maternity/paternity? Note down Y/N for these questions along with any publications or ClinVar submission IDs.

### Resources 

Use the following:
Google - search for gene + either p. or c. number
ClinVar - Gene:c.number
PubMed - search for gene + either p. or c. number
